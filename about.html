                        <p>Currently learning programming, focusing mainly on Java, but I’m eager to try out other languages and techniques too.</p>
                        <p>I have an Engineering Information Technology BSc and worked some years in various IT fields, but I figured out that I really like coding, to create things, so that’s why I started to learn it properly. Sure, I was always able to “hack” some solutions in various coding languages, but I want more. I learn using various resources, books, online courses and videos. For example, I have the “One Thousand and One Nights” achievement on Codegym, by completing 1000 tasks. That site is great to get some Java fundamentals in practice.</p>
                        <p>I also like to connect different techs for example, in my BSc thesis I wrote a learning/knowledge testing program for a university subject (basics of computer science). I used a SQL database to store the student login information and progression data. It was running on a Raspberry Pi connected to the internet, so it was fully functionally on the “backend” side too, when I was demoed it. The program itself was not exceptional, I had a very bad coding style back then, I was focused on the result, not thinking in future further development. The students were able to log in and train some basic things, like binary number calculations, with result checking, and for the theoretical questions there was quizzes (what was automatically loaded in from a folder, so the teachers could extend the question base).</p>    
                        <p>I made this site to have a little portfolio, I hope you will find something interesting here, I will add more little projects periodically.</p>
